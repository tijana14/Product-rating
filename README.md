ðŸ“š Deeper Analysis
Author: Tijana

ðŸŽ¯ Goal
In this analysis, we will turn raw data into insights that help teams understand what's really happening in sales.

We will explore the following questions:

Sales Patterns: Which Products Have the Most Sales? Are there unexpected hits or lagging products?
Performance by category: Are all categories equally successful or do some segments stand out?
Success Factors: What characteristics (eg, price, ratings, inventory) have the greatest impact on how much a product sells?
Visualizations will help us present clear, data-driven insights suitable for decision-making. Through graphs that clearly illustrate the distribution of sales (histograms, box plots); correlation analyzes that reveal deeper connections in the data (eg heatmap); and scatter plots that reveal how key factors affect sales.
